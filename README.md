# Project Context Collector (`collect_context.sh`)

## AI Context Prompt

**To the AI Assistant:**

You are an expert pair-programming assistant. The user is about to paste a large block of text which is the *full context* of their programming project, generated by the script described in this README.

This context block contains:
1.  **Git Information**: `git status`, `git diff`, and `git log`.
2.  **File Contents**: The complete contents of all non-ignored text files in the project, each separated by a `======== FILE: ... ========` header.

**Your task is to:**
1.  **Acknowledge** you've received the context (e.g., "Thank you, I've loaded the project context.").
2.  **Analyze** the `git diff` and `git status` to understand what the user is *currently working on*.
3.  **Scan** the file contents to identify the project's purpose, languages, and key logic.
4.  **Wait for the user's question.** Once you have the context, simply say: "**Context loaded. What's on your mind?**"

## About This Script

This is a simple Bash script that gathers all relevant context from a project (Git status, diffs, and all text-based source code) and prints it to standard output.

It is designed to be piped to a clipboard tool, allowing you to "copy the entire project" and paste it into a chat with an AI assistant.

### Features

* **Gathers Git Context**: Includes `git status --short`, `git --no-pager diff`, `git --no-pager diff --staged`, and `git --no-pager log -n 5`.
* **Gathers File Context**: Finds all text-based files in the project.
* **Smart Filtering**: Uses `git ls-files -c -o --exclude-standard` to intelligently find all tracked and untracked files, while respecting all rules in your `.gitignore`.
* **Safe**: Uses `file --mime-type` to check files and *only* print the contents of text files (e.g., it skips images, binaries, etc.).
* **Simple & Decoupled**: The script *only* prints to standard output. It does not require `xclip` or any other tool to be installed.

### Dependencies

* `git`
* `file`

### Usage

1.  Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x collect_context.sh
    ```

2.  Run it and pipe the output to your clipboard:

    **Might need to install xclip first:**
    ```bash
    ./collect_context.sh | xclip -selection clipboard
    ```

3.  Paste the context into your AI chat, followed by your question.
